# 📈 TeamViewer Churn and Retention Analysis

This project analyzes **TeamViewer’s financial and retention performance** using publicly available KPIs from 2022–2024.  
It also includes a real **Telco churn dataset** as an example of **effective customer retention practices**.

---

## 🔍 Objective

- Understand TeamViewer’s current growth strategy
- Identify signs of churn or retention issues
- Explore actionable improvements using Telco example

---

## 📊 Charts and Insights

### TeamViewer KPIs (2022–2024)

- **Revenue & ARR**: Consistently increasing  
- **R&D Spend**: Rising, supporting product development  
- **NRR (Net Revenue Retention)**: Decreasing → signals limited upsell/retention  
- **Churn Trend**: Unstable → acquisition-focused growth

📌 *Conclusion*: TeamViewer relies heavily on **new client acquisition**, not customer longevity.

---

### Telco Churn Dataset (Good Practices)

- **Lowest churn**: 2-year contract customers  
- **Highest churn**: Monthly plan users  
- **Most stable payments**: Auto-renewing methods (card, bank transfer)  
- **Churn drops** after ~30 months of tenure

📌 *Note: Telco dataset is real, but unrelated to TeamViewer. Used only as a reference for retention strategies.*

## ✅ Recommendations

Based on Telco best practices, TeamViewer could:

1. Introduce **long-term licensing options**
2. Encourage **auto-renewable payment methods**
3. Strengthen **onboarding in the first year**
4. Monitor and target **tenure-based churn risks**

These steps can improve **retention** and stabilize **NRR**, supporting long-term growth.
